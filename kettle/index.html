			This page demonstrates the basics of how a 3D scene is represented
			by Pixar's RenderMan scene description RIB file. Such RIB files are normally generated
			automatically by applications such as Houdini or Maya (plus Pixar's plugin). 
			However, manually
			writing RIB files using a text editor focuses attention on the way that "elements"
			such as color, opacity, shading, lighting and coordinate systems are presented to
			Pixar's PhotoRealistic RenderMan rendering system.

		<div class="centered">
		<p class="description">I found this assignment very difficult, primarily because I am used to working with Real-Time Engines and this workflow of Setting values and waiting for the render to show you the end result felt very cumbersome.<BR>
		I think my primary problem was my unfamiliarity with Maya and Renderman, I knew what results I wanted to achieve but my lack of knowledge of the software made it very frustrating trying to achieve the results I wanted.<BR><BR>
		I would have preferred to work on a smaller scene like a still life with only a few objects, so that I could focus on a few shaders and work to refine and perfect them, this would have given me the opportunity to learn more about renderman, the sheer number of objects in this scene was overwhelming for me with no prior experience with Maya or Renderman and it felt like I was just rushing to quickly apply shaders to all the objects.My scene is still quite unfinished in my eyes and will probably work on it some more at my own pace.<BR><BR>
		I think I will most likely try and work on a smaller still life in my free time to get more familiar with Renderman and all its nodes.</p>
